I am a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at Princeton University, where I primarily work with Professor [Anirudha Majumdar](https://irom-lab.princeton.edu/majumdar/) and the Intelligent Robot Motion Lab ([IRoM](https://irom-lab.princeton.edu)). I work on automated testing and robot policy evaluation. My research uses tools from applied statistics, control and systems theory, formal methods, and optimization. 

I earned my Ph.D. in Control and Dynamical Systems in June 2024 from the California Institute of Technology, where I was advised by Professor [Richard M. Murray](https://murray.cds.caltech.edu/Main_Page). My dissertation research focused on using formal methods for Test and Evaluation (T&E) of autonomous robotic systems. 

Before Caltech, I completed my Bachelors degree in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics at the University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities in 2018. As an undergraduate, I was fortunate to start my research journey with Professors [Peter Seiler](https://seiler.engin.umich.edu), [Neera Jain](https://engineering.purdue.edu/JainResearchLab/people.html), [Austin Nash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-nash-23805919a), [Ufuk Topcu](http://www.ae.utexas.edu/facultysites/topcu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page), and Dr. [Ivan Papusha](https://ivanpapusha.com). 

I also spent the summer of 2021 at [Motional](https://motional.com) as an Autonomy Research intern in the 
Behavior Prediction and Planning Group under the supervision of Dr. [Eric Wolff](http://www.ericmwolff.com) and Dr. [Tung Phan-Minh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tungmphan). At Motional, I worked on Counter-example Guided Repair of Learning-based Planners using Optimization and Bayesian inference techniques.
