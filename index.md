I am a fifth-year PhD student in Control and Dynamical Systems at California Institute of Technology. I am advised by Professor [Richard M. Murray](https://murray.cds.caltech.edu/Main_Page). 
I am interested in formal methods, robotics, and verification, validation, and testing of autonomous and cyber-physical systems. My research is on 
developing theory, algorithms, and experiments for the use of formal methods in automated test-case generation for autonomous systems. In particular, my
current work focuses on reactively testing the discrete decision-making behavior in safety-critical autonomous systems. 

Before Caltech, I earned my Bachelors degree in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics at the University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities in 2018. As an undergraduate, 
I was fortunate to conduct research with Professor [Peter Seiler](https://seiler.engin.umich.edu), Professor [Neera Jain](https://engineering.purdue.edu/JainResearchLab/people.html) and Professor [Austin Nash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-nash-23805919a), and Professor [Ufuk Topcu](http://www.ae.utexas.edu/facultysites/topcu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) and Dr. [Ivan Papusha](https://ivanpapusha.com). I also spent the summer of 2021 at [Motional](https://motional.com) as an Autonomy Research intern in the 
Behavior Prediction and Planning Group under the supervision of Dr. [Eric Wolff](http://www.ericmwolff.com) and Dr. [Tung Phan-Minh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tungmphan). At Motional, I worked on Counter-example Guided Repair of Learning-based Planners using Optimization and Bayesian inference techniques.
